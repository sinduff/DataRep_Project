Order in which programs should be run;

Step 1 - MySQL 
** open up wamp server application

** open mysql console and log into the database

** select the relevant database i.e. hrSystem

** select and display all the data for the two tables in the database
	*employees
	*genderInfo

Step 2 - Flask Server
** open up the command prompt, and 'cd' into the relevant folder

** type in 'python server.py' to get the Flask server up and running

Step 3 - Browser
** open up a browser window and type in the link for the local server also include a reference to the static html page, which will interface with the mysql database and the server, 
for example;    http://127.0.0.1:5000/index.html

** data should load into the browser from the mysql database.

** clicking on the update link will allow the user to update the data, and have it similarly update in the database

** deleting a record on the browser will also delete the record in the database

** selecting the 'create' button will create a new record for the database using the browser as the interface.
